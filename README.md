<h1><img src="./public/taupy.svg" alt="logo" width="80" align="center"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TauPy</h1>

This template is supposed to help with the creation of desktop applications that rely on a python backend. It uses [tauri](https://tauri.app/) for the main runtime and [react](https://react.dev/) for the frontend. The python environment is managed by [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) and the frontend packages are managed by [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). The project aims to be a scarce starting point to be easily transformed into the desired application.

### Features
- preset pipelines seamlessly hooking into `tauri dev` and `tauri build`
- custom port manager to handle dev and build environments
- automatic process shutdown upon exiting the application
- built-in python env management via poetry
- easy to understand folder structure

### Prerequisites
- **rust (tauri runtime)**

    for macOS use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    ```bash
    brew install rustup
    ```
    for windows use [scoop](https://scoop.sh/)
    ```bash
    scoop install main/rustup
    ```
    this project was built using rust 1.82.0, feel free to try newer stable versions
    ```bash
    rustup install 1.82.0
    rustup default 1.82.0
    ```
    for more in-depth OS specific information refer to the [tauri docs](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)

- **node (frontend runtime)**

    for macOS use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    ```bash
    brew install node
    brew install pnpm
    ```
    for windows use [scoop](https://scoop.sh/)
    ```bash
    scoop install main/nodejs
    scoop install nodejs pnpm
    ```


- **python (backend runtime)**

    for macOS use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    ```bash
    brew install python@3.12
    ```
    for windows use [scoop](https://scoop.sh/)
    ```bash
    scoop bucket add versions
    scoop install versions/python312
    ```

- **poetry (py env management)**

    it is remommended to use `pipx` to install `poetry`

    `pipx`

    for macOS use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    ```bash
    brew install pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    ```
    for windows use [scoop](https://scoop.sh/)
    ```bash
    scoop install main/pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    ```

    `poetry`

    ```bash
    pipx install poetry
    ```

### Installation

- **required**

    create the python env and install the dependencies
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
    download the frontend dependencies
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ````

### Debugging
Be aware that even though running the `dev command` will put executable files into the `./src-tauri/target/debug` directory, these artifacts cannot be run.
To generate an actual usable debug build in that location, run the `debug-build` command first. For more information on debugging in Tauri in general refer to the [tauri docs](https://tauri.app/develop/debug/).

### Template Sync
This repo includes a sync workflow using the [template-sync](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/actions-template-sync) action. For this to work correctly, in your repository settings, you have to enable 'Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests' under `Actions > General`. Once configured you can create a PR with all changes from the template using the workflow dispatch trigger. Keep in mind however, this will overwrite any code shared between the template and your repository, so you have to manually cherry-pick from the PR before merging. Usage of this feature is entirely optional.

### Disclaimer
As I am only getting started with Rust, Tauri and writing desktop applications in general, I cannot guarantee the security of this template. If you find any security issues, please report them in the `issues` section, prefably with a PR attached, and I will do my best to incorporate the changes. Any other suggestions or ideas on how to improve this template are also welcome.
